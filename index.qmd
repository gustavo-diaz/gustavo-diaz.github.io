I am an incoming Assistant Professor of Instruction at the [Department of Political Science](https://polisci.northwestern.edu/) at Northwestern University. I teach courses on statistics, statistical programming, and computational social science.

My research develops standards to navigate research design tradeoffs in the social sciences, with focus on causal inference and computational social science. My substantive work applies these ideas to the challenges to accountability, governance, and representation in the Global South and beyond.

I received my PhD from the [Department of Political Science](https://pol.illinois.edu/) at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
