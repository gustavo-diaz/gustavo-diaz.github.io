I am an Assistant Professor of Instruction at the [Department of Political Science](https://polisci.northwestern.edu/) at Northwestern University. I teach courses on statistics, statistical programming, and computational social science.

My research develops standards to navigate research design tradeoffs in the social sciences, with focus on causal inference and computational social science. My substantive work applies these ideas to questions in comparative politics and political behavior.

I received my PhD from the [Department of Political Science](https://pol.illinois.edu/) at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
