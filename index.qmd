I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Department of Political Science](https://www.mcmaster.ca/) at [McMaster University](https://politicalscience.mcmaster.ca/).

<!-- I use tools from design-based causal inference and computational social science to develop standards to navigate research design tradeoffs. My substantive work focuses on the challenges to accountability, governance, and representation in the Global South. -->

<!-- CP version -->
I research the challenges to accountability, governance, and representation in the Global South. I also use tools from design-based causal inference and computational social science to develop standards to navigate research design tradeoffs.

I received my PhD from the [Department of Political Science](https://pol.illinois.edu/) at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/). Before joining McMaster, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the [Center for Inter-American Policy and Research](https://stonecenter.tulane.edu/cipr) at [Tulane University](https://tulane.edu/).
