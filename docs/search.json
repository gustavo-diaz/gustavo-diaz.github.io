    "text": "I write to express my interest in your call for a Lecturer in International Development and Quantitative Social Science. I am a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Political Science at McMaster University. I specialize in comparative politics and quantitative methods. I received my PhD from the Department of Political Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign under the supervision of Jake Bowers, Matt Winters, Gisela Sin, and Avital Livny.\n\n\nSubstantively, I research the political economy of development with a focus on the challenges to accountability and representation in middle income countries. Methodologically, I use tools from design-based causal inference and computational social science to develop standards to navigate research design tradeoffs in quantitative methods. My work is published or forthcoming in World Development and The SAGE Handbook of Research Methods in Political Science and International Relations, and the Journal of Experimental Political Science.\n\n\n\nMy primary substantive research agenda examines the challenges to accountability and representation in middle income countries. The core of this agenda is an original data collection effort in Brazil, combining text analysis and machine learning to construct the most comprehensive dataset of corruption infractions at the local level. This dataset informs several of my ongoing research projects. For example, in a solo-authored working paper, I argue that corruption revelation drives politicians in nearby municipalities to undertake preemptive behavior to ward off a negative reaction from their constituents. While previous literature suggests that partisans might react strategically to anticipate sanctions when their political party is linked to corruption, my work shows that this behavior is even more widespread, and that politicians fear being caught in an electoral anti-corruption wave even when there is no evidence of their own wrong-doing.\n\nI also maintain a research program on the gendered electoral consequences of corruption with Kelly Senters Piazza (US Air Force Academy). In a forthcoming book chapter, we use my corruption infractions dataset to show how corruption revelation increases the proportion of female candidates running for mayor, but not their chances of winning elections. We attribute this to incumbents’ incentives to counter the rise of female politicians. In another forthcoming chapter, we discuss the challenges and opportunities of different data sources to study gender and corruption.\nThis program extends toward the gendered evaluations of officeholders’ performance in general. In a piece in World Development, we discuss how the COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to promote female political representation through increased discontent with the performance of male-led executives and by priming a health policy issue commonly associated with women. In work under review with Virginia Oliveros (Tulane), Rebecca Weitz-Shapiro (Brown), and Matt Winters (Illinois), we use a survey experiment in Argentina to show gendered differential reactions to policy implementation.\n\n\n\n\nMy methodological research agenda uses the lessons from my substantive work to develop standards to navigate research design tradeoffs in quantitative methods. My current focus of this program is on practices to improve statistical precision before data collection in experiments and quasi-experiments. In a SAGE Handbook chapter with Christopher Grady (USAID) and Jim Kuklinski (Illinois), we discuss the merits and challenges of increasingly complex survey experimental designs that improve precision at the expense of ecological validity. In a piece conditionally accepted at the Journal of Experimental Political Science, I introduce new tools to assess the validity of estimates in double list experiments. This is a variant of the list experiment that promises more precise results but comes with under-explored questionnaire design complications. In a working paper with Jake Bowers (Illinois) and Christopher Grady, we discuss the circumstances under which researchers should prefer biased yet precise estimators to analyze experimental data, including applications to block-randomization and M-estimation. In a manuscript under review with Erin Rossiter (Notre Dame), we argue how the gains in precision from adopting good practices in experimental design, such as block randomization or repeated measurement of outcomes, can be offset by explicit or implicit sample loss.\n\nMy experience as a methodology and area studies postdoc at two separate institutions has given me the opportunity to teach courses in international development and quantitative methods. At McMaster, I teach an applied research design course that emphasizes causal inference for public opinion and public policy. At Tulane, I taught an introductory course in comparative politics and a senior seminar on the challenges of developing democracies from an evidence-informed policy perspective. My work as the methods editorial assistant for the American Political Science Review also puts me in a unique position to gain exposure to the most current methods in the field, awareness of which I can incorporate into my teaching and mentoring.\nMy time at Illinois also gave me extensive teaching experience. I taught an online course on the politics of developing countries as an independent instructor and served as a teaching assistant for its in-person version. I also served as a teaching assistant for quantitative research methods courses at the undergraduate and PhD levels using a flipped classroom approach. These experiences have prepared me to teach to a diverse student body and to adapt to both online and in-person platforms.\n\n\n\nI am prepared to teach courses on the politics of the Global South, evidence-informed policy, research design, computational social science, causal inference, experiments, survey research, and statistics. You can find copies of current and sample syllabi in my website. As a first-generation scholar, my teaching philosophy emphasizes building flexible learning environments for students with different backgrounds and career goals.\n\nI believe my expertise makes me an excellent fit at King’s College London.

    "text": "I grew up in a low income family in Chile, being part of the first generation to obtain a college degree, and the only person pursuing an academic career. Moving to the United States to begin my PhD was the first time I moved abroad on a long-term basis. The main challenge during my first years of graduate school was to simultaneously learn to communicate effectively as an academic, a social scientist, and a non-native English speaker.\nI realized that my struggles were more common than I expected among peers and students. More importantly, they were rooted in subtle yet systemic patterns of discrimination. I learned to recognize that the traditional higher education setting does not give equal treatment to individuals from underrepresented backgrounds and with different learning styles and career goals. In that sense, I believe our collective challenge is to facilitate spaces for cutting-edge knowledge generation and communication that value diverse voices, even if they do not fit in conventional disciplinary molds.\nThe active principle in my approach to promote these spaces in my current work is flexibility. I believe that individuals thrive when they have the opportunity to make the most out of their strengths, even if they do not fit traditional disciplinary molds. For example, as part of my introductory course in comparative politics, I require students to submit news reports covering the politics of a region of their choosing. Normally, these assignments would take the form of a short essay, which benefits students that are more familiar with short-form writing. To create a more inclusive and flexible space, I encourage students to submit this assignment using any creative medium of their choosing, including writing, audio, video, or infographic material. Moreover, I encourage them to be creative about the meaning of “politics” and “region,” so that even those who will not benefit directly from an understanding of the course material take the opportunity to develop valuable skills.\nIn my time at Illinois, I focused on out-of-classroom learning opportunities, which I consider essential to create an inclusive environment. With support from my department’s graduate student association, I started a methods cheatsheets project in 2018. The purpose of this project was to complement our graduate methods training and reduce entry barriers to new techniques for data analysis. In this project, volunteer graduate students write a short introduction to the theory, implementation, and current debates surrounding a technique of their expertise. These resources are shared in a repository available for current and future generations. I led the project in its inception, prioritizing model-based methods that are only briefly mentioned in our graduate training. Currently, the project as expanded to include computational methods, as well as techniques for data collection and pre-processing.\nWhile my efforts so far surround teaching and learning, in the future I aim to translate these ideas into a sustainable and inclusive research program. I believe growing laboratory workflow in the social sciences is the template to follow to pursue collaborative and innovative research that respects and values the skills and contributions of all members. This framework not only creates a space for diverse voices, but also provides enough flexibility to foster dialogue across backgrounds, learning styles, and career stages. These are also safety nets to support those who may otherwise struggle with the conventional higher education setting."

This means roughly eight out of ten people in the world live in a country than can be considered “Partly Free” or “Not Free.” This trend emerges after several decades of continuous democratization.\nAt the same time, scholars, governments, and civil society organizations have redoubled their efforts to overcome the challenges to democracy around the world. Progress in research transparency and registration has lead to more coordinated efforts to produce credible evidence to determine what works, where, and why.

    "text": "The unintended electoral consequences of exposing corruption\nThe literature in political science and economics on electoral accountability highlights voters’ adverse selection problem: They prefer to have good over bad elected officials but they can only infer an incumbent’s type through observable outputs of their performance. Therefore, corrupt incumbents have incentives to hide illicit activities and appear good. To fight corruption, governments, civil society organizations, and scholars devote considerable resources to implementing and evaluating anti-corruption interventions that attempt to bridge the information gap between voters and politicians’ performance in office. However, the cumulative evidence suggests that these interventions rarely translate into voters sanctioning corrupt incumbents.\nA recent explanation for the lack of electoral sanctions is that politicians undertake preemptive behavior to ward off the negative consequences of corruption. For example, previous research shows that political parties avoid nominating legislators investigated for corruption to reelection. On the other side of the coin, research also shows that local level elected officials switch away from parties investigated for corruption after securing reelection. In short, politicians avoid direct association with corruption.\nI expand on this research in work funded by the Lemann Center for Brazilian studies at the University of Illinois, using data from a long-running anti-corruption program in Brazil that randomly selects municipalities to audit their use of federal funds, and combining text analysis and machine learning to create the most comprehensive dataset of corruption infractions to date. I make two contributions to the literature.\nFirst, in a working paper, I argue that the main reason why politicians update their behavior in reaction to increased monitoring is because they expect increased scrutiny from their constituents. This contrasts from previous work suggesting that the primary incentive is top-down enforcement. I show that being selected for auditing leads mayors to shift public spending in a attempt to minimize the chances of uncovering irregularities. Mayors selected for auditing spend less and concentrate their spending in fewer areas when they are eligible for reelection and when the audits are announced close to an election year.\nIn another working paper, I argue that politicians are also responsive to revealed corruption even when they are not directly connected to it. This is because revealed corruption drives politicians in nearby localities to undertake preemptive behavior to ward off a negative reaction from their constituents. Whereas previous literature has shown evidence that partisans might react strategically to anticipated sanctions when their political party is linked to corruption, I argue that this behavior is even more widespread and that politicians fear being caught in an electoral anti-corruption wave even when there is no evidence of their own wrong-doing. This occurs because officeholders expect their constituencies to receive the news of corruption in nearby localities and react with increased scrutiny on their performance. I show that mayors in municipalities exposed to nearby corruption are more likely to seek reelection under a different party, and that they do so in a pattern that suggests an attempt to secure more resources for reelection."

    "text": "Gendered evaluations of officeholders’ performance\nIn work with Kelly Senters Piazza (US Air Force Academy), we expand this agenda toward the gendered patterns that underlie how voters evaluate politicians’ performance in office in light of corruption. In a forthcoming book chapter in Norms, Gender and Corruption: Understanding the Nexus, we use my data on corruption infractions at the local level in Brazil to revisit previous findings on the gendered electoral consequences of corruption. Previous work in this topic uses public opinion data and survey experiments to show how revealing corruption increases support for female representation, yet also how female politicians face harsher sanctions for comparable levels of wrongdoing. We argue that these methods of inquiry do not allow us to translate their conclusions to realistic settings, which we overcome by focusing on the aforementioned anti-corruption program in Brazil. We show that revealing corruption increases support for female representation in the form of an increased proportion of female candidates running for mayor, yet this support does not translate into an increased proportion of women winning elections, which we attribute to incumbent mayors’ incentives to counter the rise of female challengers. In another chapter forthcoming in the Handbook on Gender and Corruption in Democracies, we discuss the challenges and opportunities of using different data sources to study the relationship between gender and corruption, establishing a tradeoff between validity and generalizability.\nThis program extends to the study of gendered performance evaluations beyond corruption. In a piece in World Development, we highlight how exceptional events, such as corruption, conflict, and public health disasters, can promote female political representation by raising questions around the ability of male leadership to handle crises, as well as priming voters about issues around which women are perceived to have policy expertise. Examining public opinion data and recent media coverage around the world, we argue for the presence of both mechanisms in the current global pandemic, implying a potential surge in female political representation, which in turn can help alleviate the gender inequalities exacerbated by the pandemic.\nIn work under review with Virginia Oliveros (Tulane), Rebecca Weitz-Shapiro (Brown), and Matt Winters (Illinois), we use a survey experiment in Argentina to show gendered differential reactions to policy implementation. The literature in gender and politics identifies a double bind in performance evaluations, which implies that women officeholders are simultaneously perceived as better types and held to a higher standard than their male counterparts. Most of the literature attributes this differential treatment to different expectations of what men and women should do in office. Our experiment highlights a situation where differential treatment exists even in a context of equally low expectations. We find that only men are receive credit for good policy implementation in the context of a food distribution program. We attribute this result to the voters’ perception of male politicians as the default category, meaning that the mention of their gender does not provide any additional information on performance evaluation. On the flip side, mentioning the gender of a female politician leads voters to believe that good performance stems from factors beyond the incumbent’s control."

    "section": "Improving precision before conducting an experiment",
    "text": "Improving precision before conducting an experiment\nThe last decade has seen considerable improvement in research transparency and registration. Recent advances in experimental design provide tools to diagnose the properties of a research design before data collection. For example, one can think about bias, power, or target sample size under different hypothetical data generation processes. My current agenda focuses on identifying practices and procedures that researchers can adopt at the pre-analysis stage to choose among alternative research designs. I emphasize improvements in statistical precision, the probability of detecting a non-zero effect (if it exists), since scholars studying the Global South often need to maximize limited resources.\nIn a manuscript conditionally accepted at the Journal of Experimental Political Science, I revisit double list experiments. Social scientists use list experiments in surveys when respondents may conceal their answer to sensitive questions. When their assumptions are met, list experiments reduce sensitivity biases from misreporting. However, they tend to produce estimates with high variance, which prevents researchers from improving upon direct questioning. Double list experiments promise to remedy this by implementing two parallel list experiments and then aggregating their results, which roughly halves the variance of the estimate for the prevalence of the sensitive trait. This implies an estimator that is more precise and still unbiased, but their implementation brings the question over whether the aggregation of the results of two parallel experiments yields a valid estimate. I propose a statistical test to assess the validity of estimates from double list experiments by leveraging variation in the order in which respondents receive the sensitive item, which provides researchers with a tool to apply this technique more widely.\nIn work under review with Erin Rossiter (Notre Dame), we discuss the circumstances under which adopting a research design feature aimed at improving precision can instead hurt precision through sample loss. For example, block randomization often improves precision, but it may require contacting participants multiple times to collect blocking covariates before treatment and then post-treatment outcomes. This creates space for either explicit (e.g. subjects dropping from the study between waves) or implicit sample loss (e.g. resource limitation forcing researchers to halve the sample size). Both forms of sample loss may offset the precision gains of blocking. Both standard and block randomized experiments have well-known unbiased estimators, but one must choose whether to block or not depending on the expected gains in precision. Through simulation and the reanalysis of a survey experiment on misinformation in social media, we illustrate how researchers can entertain this precision-retention tradeoff at the pre-analysis stage.\nIn work in progress with Jake Bowers (Illinois) and Christopher Grady (USAID), we discuss the circumstances under which researchers should prefer biased yet more precise estimators in the analysis of experimental data. Once again, an example of this trade-off comes from block-randomized experiments. Block-randomization entails grouping observations, conducting parallel experiments in each group, and then calculating a single treatment effect with a weighted average. Previous work in statistics suggests that block-size weights lead to an unbiased estimator of the average treatment effect in this setting. However, because experiments are expensive to implement, we illustrate situations under which researchers may prefer to sacrifice unbiasedness in favor of more precise estimates, which would lead to the use of precision weights instead, the equivalent of using fixed effects in OLS regression. We extend this idea to other estimation techniques, such as M-estimators for outcomes variables with outliers. We illustrate these ideas through simulation and by revisiting the design of a messaging field experiment conducted by the Office of Evaluation Sciences in the United States.\n\nIn a chapter with Christopher Grady (USAID) and Jim Kuklinski (Illinois) in The SAGE Handbook of Research Methods in Political Science and International Relations, we discuss the trend of increasingly more complex research designs in survey experimentation. For example, short vignettes are replaced with factorial experiments including many attributes. This increase in complexity allows researchers to isolate causal effects from the role of potential confounders, but raises concerns over whether the tasks that respondents face in survey experiments tap into the intended construct outside of the survey framework. In other words, we draw attention to the trade-off between simple designs that risk confounding bias and complex designs that yield unbiased estimates but sacrifice ecological validity."

    "text": "Geographic spillovers as a model selection task\nI also maintain a research program on navigating research design trade-offs in the analysis of geographic spillovers in quasi-experiments. In causal inference, spillovers or interference happens when the treatment assignment of one unit affect the outcome of others. I focus on the cases in which the researcher believes that spillovers occur through geographical proximity. Current methods to study spillovers from a causal inference perspective assume the researcher observes all the relevant pathways through which treatments travel.\nResearchers can justify this assumption through experiments designed to deliberately capture spillovers, but this level of control is otherwise rare. This is because researchers can credibly place units along a pathway, but theory alone does not guide how units connect to each other along that pathway. For example, if one believes that election monitoring efforts relocate election fraud to neighboring localities. How does one know what counts as a neighbor? One could commit to using distance or adjacency as a metric, but each alternative allows for multiple ways to operationalize spillovers. This implies an underlying tradeoff between narrow operationalizations that risk false positives and broad operationalizations that can introduce bias.\nIn a working paper recognized with the best poster award at the 2019 Latin American Political Methodology meeting. I propose to approach this problem as a model selection task. Researchers can express the theoretically relevant pathway as a distance metric that helps to identify all the plausible operationalizations for spillovers that follow from it. This allows researchers to be explicit about the gaps between theory and the assumptions required to justify model specification, and to use their preferred data-driven model selection criterion to choose the most appropriate model among alternatives. I illustrate the usefulness of this approach in the context of analyzing spillovers in voting registration irregularities in Ghana."

    "text": "Improving precision before conducting an experiment\nThe last decade has seen considerable improvement in research transparency and registration. Recent advances in experimental design provide tools to diagnose the properties of a research design before data collection. For example, one can think about bias, power, or target sample size under different hypothetical data generation processes.\nA recurrent goal in statistics, econometrics, and political methodology is to minimize bias. Instead, my agenda focuses on optimizing statistical precision. This implies preferring the research design feature that increases the probability of detecting a non-zero effect (if it exists) over producing an estimate that is close to the hypothetical truth in average.\nI emphasize precision over unbiasedness for two reasons. First, researchers often face the choice between alternative experimental designs for which unbiased estimators are already documented. Two projects reflect this tradeoff.\nIn a manuscript under revise and resubmit, I revisit double list experiments. Social scientists use list experiments in surveys when respondents may not answer truthfully to sensitive questions. When their assumptions are met, list experiments reduce sensitivity biases from misreporting. However, they tend to produce estimates with high variance, which prevents researchers from improving upon direct questioning. Double list experiments promise to remedy this by implementing two parallel list experiments and then aggregating their results, which roughly halves the variance of the estimate for the prevalence of the sensitive trait. This implies an estimator that is more precise and still unbiased, but their implementation brings the question over whether the aggregation of the results of two parallel experiments yields a valid estimate. I propose a statistical test to assess the validity of estimates from double list experiments by leveraging variation in the order in which respondents receive the sensitive item, which provides researchers with a tool to apply this technique more widely.\nIn a working paper with Erin Rossiter, we discuss the circumstances under which adopting a research design feature aimed at improving precision can instead hurt precision through sample loss. For example, block randomization often improves precision. However, if this requires contacting participants multiple times to collect blocking covariates first and then post-treatment outcomes, then it creates space for attrition that would not exist otherwise, which may offset the precision gains of blocking. Both standard and block randomized experiments have well-known unbiased estimators, but one must choose whether to block or not depending on the expected gains in precision. Through simulation and the reanalysis of a survey experiment on misinformation in social media, we illustrate how researchers can entertain this precision-retention tradeoff at the pre-analysis stage.\nThe second reason to focus on statistical precision is that sometimes a more precise yet biased estimator gives more informative answers than an unbiased estimator. Two other projects reflect this issue.\nFirst, in work in progress with Jake Bowers and Christopher Grady, we discuss the circumstances under which researchers should prefer biased yet more precise estimators in the analysis of experimental data. Once again, an example of this trade-off comes from block-randomized experiments. Block-randomization entails grouping observations in groups or strata, conducting parallel experiments in each, and then calculating a single treatment effect with a weighted average. Previous work in statistics suggests that block-size weights lead to an unbiased estimator of the average treatment effect in this setting. However, because experiments are expensive to implement, we illustrate situations under which researchers may prefer to sacrifice unbiasedness in favor of more precise estimates, which would lead to the use of precision weights instead, the equivalent of using fixed effects in OLS regression. We extend this idea to other estimation techniques, including covariance adjustment and M-estimation. We illustrate these ideas through simulation and by revisiting the design of a messaging field experiment conducted by the Office of Evaluation Sciences.\n\nSecond, in a chapter with Christopher Grady and Jim Kuklinski in The SAGE Handbook of Research Methods in Political Science and International Relations, we discuss the trend of increasingly more complex research designs in survey experimentation. For example, short vignettes are replaced with factorial experiments including many attributes. This increase in complexity allows researchers to isolate causal effects from the role of potential confounders, but raises concerns over whether the tasks that respondents face in survey experiments tap into the intended construct outside of the survey framework. In other words, we draw attention to the trade-off between simple designs that risk confounding bias and complex designs that yield unbiased estimates but risk ecological validity."

In causal inference, spillovers or interference happens when the treatment assignment of one unit affect the outcome of others.

Current methods to study spillovers from a causal inference perspective assume the researcher observes all the relevant pathways through which treatments travel.\nResearchers can justify this assumption through experiments designed to deliberately capture spillovers, but this level of control is otherwise rare. This is because researchers can credibly place units along a pathway, but theory alone does not guide how units connect to each other along that pathway. For example, if one believes that election monitoring efforts relocate election fraud to neighboring localities. How does one know what counts as a neighbor? One could commit to using distance or adjacency as a metric, but each alternative allows for multiple ways to operationalize spillovers. This implies an underlying tradeoff between narrow operationalizations that risk false positives and broad operationalizations that can introduce bias.\nIn a working paper recognized with the best poster award at the 2019 Latin American Political Methodology meeting. I propose to approach this problem as a model selection task. Researchers can express the theoretically relevant pathway as a distance metric that helps to identify all the plausible operationalizations for spillovers that follow from it. This allows researchers to be explicit about the gaps between theory and the assumptions required to justify model specification, and to use their preferred data-driven model selection criterion to choose the most appropriate model among alternatives.

    "section": "The unintended electoral consequences of exposing corruption",
    "text": "The unintended electoral consequences of exposing corruption\nThe literature in political science and economics on electoral accountability highlights voters’ adverse selection problem: They prefer to have good over bad elected officials but they can only infer an incumbent’s type through observable outputs of their performance. Therefore, corrupt incumbents have incentives to hide their illicit activities and appear good. To fight corruption, governments, civil society organizations, and scholars devote considerable resources to implementing and evaluating anti-corruption interventions that attempt to bridge the information gap between voters and politicians’ performance in office. However, the cumulative evidence suggests that these interventions rarely translate into voters sanctioning corrupt incumbents.\nA recent explanation for the lack of electoral sanctions is that politicians undertake preemptive behavior to ward off the negative consequences of corruption. For example, previous research shows that political parties avoid nominating legislators investigated for corruption to reelection. On the other side of the coin, research also shows that local level elected officials switch away from parties investigated for corruption after securing reelection. In short, politicians avoid direct association with corruption.\nI expand on this research in work funded by the Lemann Center for Brazilian studies at the University of Illinois, using data from a long-running anti-corruption program in Brazil that randomly selects municipalities to audit their use of federal funds, combining text analysis and machine learning to create the most comprehensive dataset of corruption infractions to date. I make two contributions to the literature.\nFirst, in a working paper, I argue that the main reason why politicians update their behavior in reaction to increased monitoring is because they expect increased scrutiny from their constituents. This contrasts from previous work suggesting that the primary incentive is top-down enforcement. I show that being selected for auditing leads mayors to shift public spending in a pattern that reveals an attempt to signal responsible spending to voters. Mayors selected for auditing spend less and concentrate their spending in fewer areas when they are eligible for reelection and when the audits are announced close to an election year.\nIn another piece under review, I argue that politicians are also responsive to revealed corruption even when they are not directly connected to it. This is because revealed corruption drives politicians in nearby localities to undertake preemptive behavior to ward off a negative reaction from their constituents. Whereas previous literature has shown evidence that partisans might react strategically to anticipated sanctions when their political party is linked to corruption, I argue that this behavior is even more widespread and that politicians fear being caught in an electoral anti-corruption wave even when there is no evidence of their own wrong-doing. This occurs because officeholders expect their constituencies to receive the news of corruption in nearby localities and react with increased scrutiny on their performance. I show that mayors in municipalities exposed to nearby corruption are more likely to seek reelection under a different party, and that they do so in a pattern that suggests an attempt to secure more resources for reelection."

    "text": "Gendered evaluations of officeholders’ performance\nIn work with Kelly Senters Piazza, we expand this agenda toward the gendered patterns that underlie how voters evaluate politicians’ performance in office in light of corruption. In a forthcoming book chapter in Norms, Gender and Corruption: Understanding the Nexus, we use my data on corruption infractions at the local level in Brazil to revisit previous findings on the gendered electoral consequences of corruption. Previous work in this topic uses public opinion data and survey experiments to show how revealing corruption increases support for female representation, yet also how female politicians face harsher sanctions for comparable levels of wrongdoing. We argue that these methods of inquiry do not allow us to translate their conclusions to realistic settings, which we overcome by focusing on the aforementioned anti-corruption program in Brazil. We show that revealing corruption increases support for female representation in the form of an increased proportion of female candidates running for mayor, yet this support does not translate into an increased proportion of women winning elections, which we attribute to incumbent mayors’ incentives to counter the rise of female challengers. In another book chapter currently in progress, we discuss the challenges and opportunities of different data sources to study gender and corruption.\nThis program extends to gendered performance evaluations beyond corruption. In a piece in World Development, we highlight how exceptional events, such as corruption, conflict, and public health disasters, can promote female political representation by raising questions around the ability of male leadership to handle crises, as well as priming voters about issues around which women are perceived to have policy expertise. Examining public opinion data and recent media coverage around the world, we argue for the presence of both mechanisms in the current global pandemic, implying a potential surge in female political representation, which in turn can help alleviate the gender inequalities exacerbated by the pandemic.\nIn work in progress with Virginia Oliveros, Rebecca Weitz-Shapiro, and Matt Winters, we use a survey experiment in Argentina to show gendered differential reactions to policy implementation. The literature in gender and politics identifies a double bind in performance evaluations, which implies that women officeholders are simultaneously perceived as better types and held to a higher standard than their male counterparts. Most of the literature attributes this differential treatment to different expectations of what men and women should do in office. Our experiment highlight a situation where differential treatment exists even in a context of equally low expectations. We find that only men are receive credit for good policy implementation in the context of a food distribution program. We attribute this result to the voters’ perception of male politicians as the default category, meaning that the mention of their gender does not provide any additional information on performance evaluation. On the flip side, mentioning the gender of a female politician leads voters to believe that good performance stems from factors beyond the incumbent’s control."

This allows researchers to be explicit about the gaps between theory and the assumptions required to justify model specification, and to use their preferred data-driven model selection criterion to choose the most appropriate model among alternatives. I illustrate the usefulness of this approach in the context of analyzing spillovers in voting registration irregularities in Ghana."

    "text": "The unintended electoral consequences of exposing corruption\nThe literature in political science and economics on electoral accountability highlights voters’ adverse selection problem: They prefer to have good over bad elected officials but they can only infer an incumbent’s type through observable outputs of their performance. Therefore, corrupt incumbents have incentives to hide their illicit activities and appear good. To fight corruption, governments, civil society organizations, and scholars devote considerable resources to implementing and evaluating anti-corruption interventions that attempt to bridge the information gap between voters and politicians’ performance in office. However, the cumulative evidence suggests that these interventions rarely translate into voters sanctioning corrupt incumbents.\nA recent explanation for the lack of electoral sanctions is that politicians undertake preemptive behavior to ward off the negative consequences of corruption. For example, previous research shows that political parties avoid nominating legislators investigated for corruption to reelection. On the other side of the coin, research also shows that local level elected officials switch away from parties investigated for corruption after securing reelection. In short, politicians avoid direct association with corruption.\nI expand on this research in work funded by the Lemann Center for Brazilian studies at the University of Illinois, using data from a long-running anti-corruption program in Brazil that randomly selects municipalities to audit their use of federal funds, combining text analysis and machine learning to create the most comprehensive dataset of corruption infractions to date. I make two contributions to the literature.\nFirst, in a working paper, I argue that the main reason why politicians update their behavior in reaction to increased monitoring is because they expect increased scrutiny from their constituents. This contrasts from previous work suggesting that the primary incentive is top-down enforcement. I show that being selected for auditing leads mayors to shift public spending in a pattern that reveals an attempt to signal responsible spending to voters. Mayors selected for auditing spend less and concentrate their spending in fewer areas when they are eligible for reelection and when the audits are announced close to an election year.\nIn another piece under review, I argue that politicians are also responsive to revealed corruption even when they are not directly connected to it. This is because revealed corruption drives politicians in nearby localities to undertake preemptive behavior to ward off a negative reaction from their constituents. Whereas previous literature has shown evidence that partisans might react strategically to anticipated sanctions when their political party is linked to corruption, I argue that this behavior is even more widespread and that politicians fear being caught in an electoral anti-corruption wave even when there is no evidence of their own wrong-doing. This occurs because officeholders expect their constituencies to receive the news of corruption in nearby localities and react with increased scrutiny on their performance. I show that mayors in municipalities exposed to nearby corruption are more likely to seek reelection under a different party, and that they do so in a pattern that suggests an attempt to secure more resources for reelection."

We attribute this result to the voters’ perception of male politicians as the default category, meaning that the mention of their gender does not provide any additional information on performance evaluation.

This means roughly eight out of ten people in the world live in a country than can be considered “Partly Free” or “Not Free.” This trend emerges after decades of continuous improvements to democracy.\nAt the same time, scholars, governments, and civil society organizations have redoubled their efforts to overcome the challenges to democracy around the world. Progress in research transparency and registration has lead to more coordinated efforts to produce credible evidence to determine what works, where, and why. The outstanding challenge in this area is that the empirical implications we wish to study are hard to observe directly.\nMy research focuses on the threats to democratic accountability and representation in the Global South. This is an area where strategic behavior from both citizens and politicians precludes the identification of successful interventions. My current agenda analyzes the unintended electoral consequences of investigating and exposing corruption, as well as the gendered patterns in citizens’ evaluation of politicians’ performance in office.\nGiven the focus on hard-to-observe phenomena, this substantive agenda also informs a methodological program on the application of tools from design-based causal inference and computational social science to navigate research design tradeoffs in experiments and quasi-experiments."

    "section": "Improving precision before conducting an experiment",
    "text": "Improving precision before conducting an experiment\nThe last decade has seen considerable improvement in research transparency and registration. Recent advances in experimental design provide tools to diagnose the properties of a research design before data collection. For example, one can think about bias, power, or target sample size under different hypothetical data generation processes. My current agenda focuses on identifying practices and procedures that researchers can adopt at the pre-analysis stage to choose among alternative research designs. I emphasize improvements in statistical precision, the probability of detecting a non-zero effect (if it exists), since researchers studying the Global South often need to maximize limited resources.\nIn a manuscript under revise and resubmit, I revisit double list experiments. Social scientists use list experiments in surveys when respondents may not answer truthfully to sensitive questions. When their assumptions are met, list experiments reduce sensitivity biases from misreporting. However, they tend to produce estimates with high variance, which prevents researchers from improving upon direct questioning. Double list experiments promise to remedy this by implementing two parallel list experiments and then aggregating their results, which roughly halves the variance of the estimate for the prevalence of the sensitive trait. This implies an estimator that is more precise and still unbiased, but their implementation brings the question over whether the aggregation of the results of two parallel experiments yields a valid estimate. I propose a statistical test to assess the validity of estimates from double list experiments by leveraging variation in the order in which respondents receive the sensitive item, which provides researchers with a tool to apply this technique more widely.\nIn a working paper with Erin Rossiter (Notre Dame), we discuss the circumstances under which adopting a research design feature aimed at improving precision can instead hurt precision through sample loss. For example, block randomization often improves precision. However, if this requires contacting participants multiple times to collect blocking covariates first and then post-treatment outcomes, then it creates space for attrition that would not exist otherwise, which may offset the precision gains of blocking. Both standard and block randomized experiments have well-known unbiased estimators, but one must choose whether to block or not depending on the expected gains in precision. Through simulation and the reanalysis of a survey experiment on misinformation in social media, we illustrate how researchers can entertain this precision-retention tradeoff at the pre-analysis stage.\nIn work in progress with Jake Bowers (Illinois) and Christopher Grady (USAID), we discuss the circumstances under which researchers should prefer biased yet more precise estimators in the analysis of experimental data. Once again, an example of this trade-off comes from block-randomized experiments. Block-randomization entails grouping observations in groups or strata, conducting parallel experiments in each, and then calculating a single treatment effect with a weighted average. Previous work in statistics suggests that block-size weights lead to an unbiased estimator of the average treatment effect in this setting. However, because experiments are expensive to implement, we illustrate situations under which researchers may prefer to sacrifice unbiasedness in favor of more precise estimates, which would lead to the use of precision weights instead, the equivalent of using fixed effects in OLS regression. We extend this idea to other estimation techniques, including covariance adjustment and M-estimation. We illustrate these ideas through simulation and by revisiting the design of a messaging field experiment conducted by the Office of Evaluation Sciences.\n\nIn a chapter with Christopher Grady (USAID) and Jim Kuklinski (Illinois) in The SAGE Handbook of Research Methods in Political Science and International Relations, we discuss the trend of increasingly more complex research designs in survey experimentation. For example, short vignettes are replaced with factorial experiments including many attributes. This increase in complexity allows researchers to isolate causal effects from the role of potential confounders, but raises concerns over whether the tasks that respondents face in survey experiments tap into the intended construct outside of the survey framework. In other words, we draw attention to the trade-off between simple designs that risk confounding bias and complex designs that yield unbiased estimates but risk ecological validity."

    "text": "Geographic spillovers as a model selection task\nI also maintain a research program on navigating research design trade-offs in the analysis of geographic spillovers in quasi-experiments. In causal inference, spillovers or interference happens when the treatment assignment of one unit affect the outcome of others. I focus on the cases in which the researcher believes that spillovers occur through geographical proximity. Current methods to study spillovers from a causal inference perspective assume the researcher observes all the relevant pathways through which treatments travel.\nResearchers can justify this assumption through experiments designed to deliberately capture spillovers, but this level of control is otherwise rare. This is because researchers can credibly place units along a pathway, but theory alone does not guide how units connect to each other along that pathway. For example, if one believes that election monitoring efforts relocate election fraud to neighboring localities. How does one know what counts as a neighbor? One could commit to using distance or adjacency as a metric, but each alternative allows for multiple ways to operationalize spillovers. This implies an underlying tradeoff between narrow operationalizations that risk false positives and broad operationalizations that can introduce bias.\nIn a working paper recognized with the best poster award at the 2019 Latin American Political Methodology meeting. I propose to approach this problem as a model selection task. Researchers can express the theoretically relevant pathway as a distance metric that helps to identify all the plausible operationalizations for spillovers that follow from it. This allows researchers to be explicit about the gaps between theory and the assumptions required to justify model specification, and to use their preferred data-driven model selection criterion to choose the most appropriate model among alternatives.

Since students come from different paths and have different career goals, I emphasize developing the skill to think and communicate in the language of the social sciences and translate it to different situations. This gives students the flexibility to engage with the course material on their own terms and apply it to their interests. This approach also creates a set of communication rules that everyone is accountable to, which allows individual students to stay on task no matter how much their interests differ from the course content and provides the group with tools to manage instances of discrimination in the classroom and beyond.\nWhen teaching comparative politics, I highlight how the complexities of multiple causation in understanding patterns of development around the world translate to policy evaluation and everyday political discussion. I accomplish this by encouraging students to draw analogies between the course material and their personal experiences or interests. For example, my introduction to comparative politics course requires students to deliver news reports on political events in a region of their choosing. I encourage the most generous definitions of “political” and “region”. This has led to reports that cover general elections in Germany, homelessness in Seattle, and the allocation of Mardi Gras parade routes. I also allow students to deliver the report using any creative media on their choosing. This means students who are not driven by the course content alone can still use the material as an excuse to practice a skill or pursue their interests.\nIn teaching research design and quantitative methods, I focus on introducing the language of social science research design and data analysis. One complication in teaching political data analysis is that students may be more accustomed to discuss politics in normative terms, which can contaminate statistical considerations. For example, the debate of what makes a candidate win an election may push some students away from the conversation to avoid confrontation, harming our understanding of multivariate regression models. I like to use less controversial examples to illustrate a method, and then move towards their application to important political topics. For instance, I start teaching multivariate regression with a discussion of the factors that may influence the price of a house, and then use it as a foundation to approach complex political phenomena with multiple causes.\nBy the end of the course, my students leave with the feeling of having acquired a new skill that they can practice and adapt to other aspects of their life, ranging from everyday conversations to the advancement of their career. I see the ability of translating social science to multiple domains as an invaluable skill in a world that is becoming simultaneously more technical and more political.\n\n\nTeaching experience\nI have experience teaching substantive and methodological courses to diverse audiences and under different formats.

I also taught an undergrad senior course on the challenges of developing democracies from the perspective of evidence-based policymaking. This course overviews the main challenges in the path to democratic consolidation around the world, the proposed solutions to these challenges, and introduces conceptual tools for credible causal inference in policy evaluation.\nIn my time at Illinois, I benefited from exposure to different versions of an introductory course to the politics on developing countries. I taught an online version of this course as an independent instructor following Matt Winters’ syllabus, which emphasizes theoretical accounts of economic and political development. I also served as a teaching assistant for Avital Livny’s version, which emphasizes building social science concepts and tools to understand cross-national variation in economic development, state formation, regime change, and ethnic conflict.\nI also have experience teaching data analysis and research methods.

    "text": "Teaching philosophy\nI approach teaching political science and research methods as the task of acquiring a new language. Since students come from different paths and have different career goals, I emphasize developing the skill to think and communicate in the language of the social sciences and translate it to different situations. This gives students the flexibility to engage with the course material on their own terms and apply it to their interests. This approach also creates a set of communication rules that everyone is accountable to, which allows individual students to stay on task no matter how much their interests differ from the course content and provides the group with tools to manage instances of racism, sexism, and other biases.\nIn teaching research design and quantitative methods, I focus on introducing the language of social science research design and data analysis. One complication in teaching political data analysis is that students may be more accustomed to discuss politics in normative terms, which can contaminate statistical considerations. For example, the debate of what makes a candidate win an election may push some students away from the conversation to avoid confrontation, harming our understanding of multivariate regression models. I like to use less controversial examples to illustrate a method, and then move towards their application to important political topics. For instance, I start teaching multivariate regression with a discussion of the factors that may influence the price of a house, and then use it as a foundation to approach complex political phenomena with multiple causes.\nIn teaching political science, I highlight how the complexities of multiple causation in understanding patterns of development around the world translate to policy evaluation and everyday political discussion. I accomplish this by encouraging students to draw analogies between the course material and their personal experiences or interests. For example, my introduction to comparative politics course requires students to deliver news reports on political events in a region of their choosing. I encourage the most generous definitions of “political” and “region”. This has led to reports that cover general elections in Germany, homelessness in Seattle, and the allocation of Mardi Gras parade routes. I also allow students to deliver the report using any creative media on their choosing. This means students who are not driven by the course content alone can still use the material as an excuse to practice a skill or pursue their interests.\nBy the end of the course, my students leave with the feeling of having acquired a new skill that they can practice and adapt to other aspects of their life, ranging from everyday conversations to the advancement of their career. I see the ability of translating social science to multiple domains as an invaluable skill in a world that is becoming simultaneously more technical and more political.\n\n\nTeaching experience\nI have experience teaching substantive and methodological courses to diverse audiences and under different formats. In the Spring, I will teach an applied research design course on public policy and public opinion. The goal of this course is to give students hands-on experience in designing a quantitative research project in an area relevant to academia, policy, or industry.\nI also taught introduction to comparative politics, emphasizing theoretical and methodological considerations at the core of the course, while simultaneously encouraging students to apply this knowledge to recent events in a region or country of their choosing. I also taught an undergrad senior course on the challenges of developing democracies from the perspective of evidence-based policymaking. This course overviews the main challenges in the path to democratic consolidation around the world, the proposed solutions to these challenges, and introduces conceptual tools for credible causal inference in policy evaluation\nDuring my PhD studies, I taught statistics and research methods. In the 2020-2021 academic year, I was the graduate methods teaching assistant in our department. My duties involved advising PhD students taking courses in the quantitative methods sequence, as well as mentoring undergraduates enrolled in the senior honors thesis program. I served as a teaching assistant for Jake Bowers’ introduction to data analysis for political science majors. This course focuses on flipped classroom learning, letting students engage with the course material on their own time and using lecture time to work as a group on problem sets and research projects. I have also contributed as a math camp instructor for three consecutive years, introducing statistical programming in R to incoming graduate students in our department.\nI also had experience teaching comparative politics. I benefited from exposure to different versions of an introductory course to the politics on developing countries. I taught an online version of this course as an independent instructor, which emphasizes theoretical accounts of economic and political development. I also served as a teaching assistant for an in-person version, which emphasizes building social science concepts and tools to understand cross-national variation in economic development, state formation, regime change, and ethnic conflict.\nTeaching to diverse audiences made me aware of the importance of promoting out-of classroom learning experiences. I organized a reading group on computational social sciencethat met regularly in the Summer and Fall of 2017. I started a a collaborative project in which graduate students share cheatsheets introducing their fellows to new methodological tools. I have also enjoyed the experience of mentoring an undergraduate research assistant, using the opportunity to help both of us learn text analysis. In the future, I plan to facilitate similar learning experiences in every aspect of my work.\n\n\nTeaching interests\nI am prepared to teach courses on research design, causal inference, statistics for public policy, and computational social science. I can also teach substantive courses on evidence-informed public policy and the politics of the Global South. You can find copies of current and sample syllabi in my website."
