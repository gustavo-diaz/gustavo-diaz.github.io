## ArriveCAN

## COVID screening questions

![](figs/arrivecan.png){fig-align="center"}

## What proportion of app users answered "yes" to having symptoms?

. . .

- If you are **not** sick, you answer **no**

. . .

- If you are sick...

. . .

- You don't travel and don't use the app 

. . .

**OR**
    
. . .

- You lie about having symptoms and travel anyway

## From a social science perspective

::: incremental

- We use surveys a lot

- Many questions are **too sensitive** to ask directly

- But these are things we care about!

- **Examples:** Racial prejudice, support for rebel groups, sexual and reproductive behavior

- Many techniques use **indirect** questions to elicit **honest answers** while **protecting anonymity**
