## ArriveCAN

## COVID screening questions

![](figs/arrivecan.png){fig-align="center"}

## What proportion of app users answered "yes" to having symptoms?

. . .

- If you are **not** sick, you answer **no**

. . .

- If you are sick...

. . .

- You don't travel and don't use the app 

. . .

**OR**
    
. . .

- You lie about having symptoms and travel anyway

## From a social science perspective

::: incremental

- We use surveys a lot

- Many questions are **too sensitive** to ask directly

- But these are things we care about!

- **Examples:** Racial prejudice, support for rebel groups, sexual and reproductive behavior

- Many techniques use **indirect** questions to elicit **honest answers** while **protecting anonymity**

## List experiments

Here is a list of things that some people have
done. Tell me HOW MANY of them you
have done in the past two years. Do not tell me
which ones. Just tell me
how many:

. . .

- Discussed politics with family or friends
- Cast a ballot for Governor Phil Bryant
- Paid dues to a union
- Given money to a Tea Party candidate or organization

## Prevalence estimate

$$
\text{Prevalence(X)} = \text{Mean(List with X)} - \text{Mean(List without X)}
$$

. . .

- Proportion of individuals in the target population who hold the sensitive attitude or behavior

- We obtain an estimate while keeping individual responses anonymous 

## This reduces sensitivity bias

## To make matters worse

::: incremental
- More sensitive attitudes {{< fa arrow-right >}} more interesting {{< fa arrow-right >}} more uncommon {{< fa arrow-right >}} harder to detect

- Some sensitive attitudes are more prevalent among hard-to-reach populations `(e.g. interactions with criminal organizations)`

- Multiple sensitive attitudes increase sample size requirements

- Same when comparing subgroup effects

- **Very hard to make list experiments work**

## Double list experiments

```{r}
A00 = c("Californians for Disability (organization advocating for people with disabilities)",
       "California National Organization for Women (organization advocating for women's equality and empowerment)",
       "American Family Association (organization advocating for pro-family values)",
       "American Red Cross (humanitarian organization)")

B00 = c("American Legion (veterans service organization)",
       "Equality California (gay and lesbian advocacy organization)",
       "Tea Party Patriots (conservative group supporting lower taxes and limited government)",
       "Salvation Army (charitable organization)")

tab_00 = data.frame(A00, B00)

colnames(tab_00) = c("List A", "List B")

kbl(tab_00, format = "markdown")
