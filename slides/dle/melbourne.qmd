## Presentation topic {.smaller}

Give a presentation that showcases how you would teach an important concept in research methods related to your research to advanced undergraduate students in political science. Reflect on why you have chosen this concept for students and explain why you are going about teaching it this way. 

Include within this presentation brief instructions to students for a class activity designed to support student learning about this concept (you do not need to implement this activity during your presentation). 

Follow this presentation with an outline of how your current and future research will complement and enhance research in the School of Social and Political Sciences at the University of Melbourne. 

Total time for presentation: 25 minutes (approximately 20 minutes for the teaching presentation, and 5 minutes for the research overview). Audience members will include the selection panel, and current staff and PhD students in the School. There will be 10 minutes for questions from the audience.

## Sensitive questions

::: incremental

- Have you lied about having COVID symptoms?

- Would you bribe a police officer to avoid a traffic ticket?

- Have you had sex after drinking alcohol?

- Have you been offered goods or favors for your vote?

- Would you oppose a black family moving next door?

- Would you allow Muslim immigrants to become citizens?

:::

## Techniques to reduce sensitivity bias

- Honesty appeals

- Communicating confidentiality protocols

- Randomized response

- Network scale-up

- Endorsement experiments

- List experiments

1. Discussed politics with family or friends
2. Cast a ballot for governor Phil Bryant
3. Paid dues to a union
4. Given money to a Tea Party candidate
5. **Voted "YES" on the Personhood Initiative**

## Prevalence rate

$$
\text{Prevalence(X)} = \text{Mean(List with X)} - \text{Mean(List without X)}
$$

. . .

- Proportion of individuals in the target population who hold the sensitive attitude or behavior

- But we **do not know** who they are in our survey!

  estimate = c(0.396, 0.487),
  upper = c(0.419, 0.562),
  lower = c(0.376, 0.417)

## Sensitive item

**Organization X (advocating for immigration reduction and measures against undocumented immigration)**

::: incremental
- Randomly appears in list A or B

- Equivalent to making two parallel list experiments

- Calculate prevalence by averaging the two single-list estimates

## But this is not for free {{< fa laptop-code >}}

::: incremental
1. Simulate a survey of $N = 1000$ that asks a sensitive question

2. Pick a *true* prevalence rate

3. Is the sensitivity bias reduction worth the precision loss?

4. Would a DLE perform better?

5. What if the extra piloting of the DLE means you only have a budget for $N/2$?

6. Do your conclusions change if you modify $N$ or the prevalence rate?

## Navigating research design tradeoffs


1. Improving precision without sacrificing unbiasedness

2. Preferring precision over unbiasedness

    - [Block randomization](https://egap.org/resource/sd-block-rand/)
  
## Challenges to accountability and representation in the Global South

1. Politicians anticipate accountability for corruption
