## Learning goals

::: incremental

- **Specific:** Different versions of the same survey question change the answers we get

- **General:** Illustrate bias-variance tradeoff in statistics

:::

## Bias-variance tradeoff as darts

![This shows up in causal inference, machine learning, measurement, and many more!](figs/darts.png){fig-align="center"}

## Questions

::: incremental

- Have you lied about having COVID symptoms?

- Would you bribe a police officer to avoid a traffic ticket?

- Have you had sex after drinking alcohol?

- Have you been offered goods or favors for your vote?

- Would you oppose a black family moving next door?

- Would you allow Muslim immigrants to become citizens?

:::

## What do these have in common?

::: incremental
- They are **sensitive questions**

- We can only learn about them using surveys 

- **But** asking about them directly leads to **misreporting**

- This form of measurement error is called **sensitivity bias**
:::

## Techniques to reduce sensitivity bias

- Honesty appeals

- Communicating confidentiality protocols

- Randomized response

- Network scale-up

- Endorsement experiments

- List experiments

1. Discussed politics with family or friends
2. Cast a ballot for governor Phil Bryant
3. Paid dues to a union
4. Given money to a Tea Party candidate
5. **Voted "YES" on the Personhood Initiative**

## Prevalence rate

$$
\text{Prevalence(X)} = \text{Mean(List with X)} - \text{Mean(List without X)}
$$

. . .

- **Estimate:** Proportion of individuals in the target population who hold the sensitive attitude or behavior

- But we **do not know** who they are in our survey!

  estimate = c(0.396, 0.487),
  upper = c(0.419, 0.562),
  lower = c(0.376, 0.417)
)

actual_vote = 0.65

## Double list experiment {.smaller}

**List A**

- Californians for Disability (advocating for people with disabilities)

- American Family Association (advocating for pro-family values)
- American Red Cross (humanitarian organization)

**List B**

- Tea Party Patriots (conservative group supporting lower taxes and limited government)

## Sensitive item

**Organization X (advocating for immigration reduction and measures against undocumented immigration)**

::: incremental
- Randomly appears in list A or B

- Equivalent to making two parallel list experiments

- Calculate prevalence by averaging the two single-list estimates
:::

## Yields more precise estimates

```{r}
ggplot(est_df %>% filter(experiment == "X")) +
  aes(x = term, y = estimate, shape = term) +

## But this is not for free

::: incremental
- Need the two questions to measure the same thing

- **Advice:** Pick baseline lists that are as similar as possible

- **BUT** that makes it easier to spot the *sensitive item*

## Summary {background-color="#00b176"}

- Three approaches to sensitive questions

. . .

1. **Direct question:** High bias, low variance

2. **List experiment:** Low bias, high variance

3. **Double list experiment:** Low bias, low variance, easier to break

. . .

- Need extensive piloting to choose well

## Activity

- Imagine something people tend to hide

- How common do you think it is among your friends/peers/community?

- Design a list experiment to learn about it

- How many people would you ask?

- How many lists?

- How many and which baseline items?

- Would it be any different from asking directly?

## Navigating research design tradeoffs


1. Improving precision without sacrificing unbiasedness

    - [Double list experiments](https://gustavodiaz.org/files/research/dle_test.pdf)
    

2. Preferring precision over unbiasedness

    - [Block randomization](https://egap.org/resource/sd-block-rand/)
    
. . .

- **Applications:** Accountability, governance, and representation in low/medium income countries

    - Blocking + DLE to estimate prevalence of criminal governance strategies in Uruguay
