## Learning goals

::: incremental

- **Specific:** Different versions of the same survey question change the answers we get

- **General:** Illustrate bias-variance tradeoff in statistics

- **Context:** List experiments

:::

## Bias-variance tradeoff as darts

![This shows up in causal inference, machine learning, measurement, and many more!](figs/darts.png){fig-align="center"}

## Questions

::: incremental

- Have you lied about having COVID symptoms?

- Would you bribe a police officer to avoid a traffic ticket?

- Have you had sex after drinking alcohol?

- Have you been offered goods or favors for your vote?

- Do you know anyone with links to a militant organization?

- Would you oppose a black family moving next door?

- Would you allow Muslim immigrants to become citizens?


:::

## What do these have in common?

::: incremental
- They are **sensitive questions**

- We can only learn about them using surveys 

- **But** asking about them directly leads to **misreporting**

- This form of measurement error is called **sensitivity bias**
:::

## Techniques to reduce sensitivity bias

- Honesty appeals

- Communicating confidentiality protocols

- Randomized response

- Network scale-up

- Endorsement experiments

- List experiments

### Treatment group

1. Discussed politics with family or friends
2. Cast a ballot for governor Phil Bryant
3. Paid dues to a union
4. Given money to a Tea Party candidate
5. **Voted "YES" on the Personhood Initiative**

## Prevalence rate

$$
\text{Prevalence(Voted yes)} =\\ \text{Mean(List with sensitive item)} -\\ \text{Mean(List without sensitive item)}
$$

. . .

- **Estimate:** Proportion of individuals in the target population who hold the sensitive attitude or behavior

- But we **do not know** how individual respondents voted!

## Compare with direct question

Did you vote YES or NO on the Personhood Initiative, which appeared on the November 2011 Mississippi General Election Ballot?

\text{Prevalence(Voted yes)} =\\ \text{Mean(Voted yes)}

## Sensitive item

**Organization X (advocating for immigration reduction and measures against undocumented immigration)**

::: incremental
- Randomly appears in list A or B

- **Single list:** Half of the respondents see sensitive item

- **Double list:** Everyone sees it

- Equivalent to making two parallel list experiments

## Three prevalence estimators

$$
\text{Prevalence}_A = \text{Mean}(A_t) - \text{Mean}(A_c)

## Summary {background-color="#00b176"}

- Three approaches to sensitive questions

. . .



1. **Direct question:** High bias, high precision ![](figs/darts_direct.png){width=60}

2. **List experiment:** Low bias, low precision ![](figs/darts_list.png){width=60}

3. **Double list experiment:** Low bias, high precision ![](figs/darts_dle.png){width=60} <br> `(but easier to break)` 

. . .

- Need extensive piloting to choose well

## Activity (groups 3-4)

- Imagine something people tend to hide

- How common do you think it is among your friends/peers/community?

- Design a list experiment to learn about it

- How many people would you ask?

- How many lists?

- How many and which baseline items?

- Would it be any different from asking directly?

## Navigating research design tradeoffs


1. Improving precision without sacrificing unbiasedness

    - Double list experiments [(Diaz 2023)](https://gustavodiaz.org/files/research/dle_test.pdf)
    

2. Preferring precision over unbiasedness

    - Block randomization [(Bowers, Diaz, and Grady 2023)](https://egap.org/resource/sd-block-rand/)
    
. . .

- **Applications:** Accountability, governance, and representation in low/medium income countries

    - Blocking + DLE to estimate prevalence of criminal governance strategies in Uruguay

### 1. No liars

Those who **do not** hold the sensitive item **never** falsely claim to bear it.

::: {.callout-warning}

Including the sensitive item **does not change** how participants respond to the baseline items
