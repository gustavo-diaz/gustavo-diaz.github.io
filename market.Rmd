                  sheet = 1)

# some manipulation to show only what is useful
jobs = jobs %>% 
# don't show if already applied
  filter(is.na(applied)) %>% 
# filter deadlines within treshold
filter(as_date(deadline) <= as_date(t)) %>% 
  mutate(
  # url = paste0('<a href="', url,'"target="_blank"></a>'),
